# Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is particularly useful when you need to work with a group of objects in the same way as a single object.
