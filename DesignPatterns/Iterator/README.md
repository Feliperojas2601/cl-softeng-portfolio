# Iterator Pattern

The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of a collection (such as a list, array, or custom data structure) sequentially without exposing the underlying representation of the collection. It decouples the traversal logic from the collection itself, allowing the collection to change its internal structure without affecting the client code that iterates over it.
