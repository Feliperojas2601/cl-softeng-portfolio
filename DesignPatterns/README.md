# TsDesignPatterns

**TsDesignPatterns** is a TypeScript implementation of the design pattern examples proposed in O'Reilly's second edition of the "Head First Design Patterns" book.

## Description

This project aims to provide a clear and concise TypeScript implementation of various design patterns. Each pattern is organized into its own directory, making it easy to navigate and understand.

## Usage

To execute the examples for each design pattern, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory of the desired design pattern:
  ```sh
  cd /path/to/pattern
  ```

2. Run the example using ts-node:
  ```sh
  npm i && npx ts-node index.ts
  ```
